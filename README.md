# Supabase crud app.

### Simple Todo app with backend functionality

This is a simple todo app using React/Vite/React Router/Tailwind/Supabase

Was used to test protected routes with authentication from supabase and sending and retrieving data with supabase

Live demo @ https://supa-crud.coderchris.dev/

NOTE - There is nothing on the "Home" route. To get access to the todo ability please click dashboard. This was intentional and just a test before building my next project.
